<h1> Here Is Our Story! </h1>
<h2> From the beginning of time, until now. </h2>

<body> 
	<p> It all started in 7th grade. I was walking through the playground when I spotted 
	a young boy standing, waiting for the bell to ring. See, he was a very eager young boy
	 and always wanted to be in the classroom learning. I, on the other hand was a young girl, looking 
	 for any trouble I could get into. <p>
